--------------------------------

Welcome to **DocuLinkr**! This tool helps you **merge**, **link**, and **serve** documentation from multiple Git repositories into a single [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) website.

## Why DocuLinkr?

* **Centralize** scattered docs: Keep individual projects in separate repos, but view them together.
* **Automate** merges: One command pulls in each project's `docs/` folder.
* **Live Preview**: Link subprojects locally and serve with Docusaurus's hot-reload.
* **Minimal Setup**: Just Python, Node.js, npm, and Gitâ€”no manual copying.

**This site is made with DocuLinkr. A live example of what you can build!**
