# Mixins – Customising Operators & Symbols *(coming soon)*

Symantex will expose a *mixin* system so you can:

* map proprietary domain operators (e.g. `softplus`, `attenuation`) to bespoke `sympy.Function` subclasses;
* bundle common variable sets (random‑variable conventions, physics constants) into reusable profiles; and
* register them via `sx.add_mixin(MyProbabilityMixin)`.

Stay tuned – the API is stabilising and full docs will land here shortly.
